    <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>Salsa verde is a tomato salsa made from tomatillo(green) tomatos. It is a simple yet flavorful salsa that can be modified endlessly. Yet, is appreciated best when kept to its least ingredients! This recipe uses just 4 ingredients to make a delicious salsa that can be used on a wide variety of things like quesdillas, tamales, meat dishes, tacos, ect!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>5 ripe tomatillos</li><li>1/4 of a medium sized white onion</li><li>2 cloves of garlic</li><li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First peel the husks off the the tomatillos and give them a good rinse</li><li>Next heat up a comal to medium heat and sit the tomatillos on there. As they heat up the skin will start to blacken. Make sure to turn them as they start to cook so the tomatillos are charred evenly on the outside</li><li>Add the onion and the garlic to the comal as well and cooked until well charred on all side</li><li>When everything has a nice blackened look take them off the comal</li><li>This step can be either done with a blender, imerssion blender, or a molecajete (if you want to be really authentic!). Take the tomatillos, onion, and garlic and blend them up until there are no more big chunks</li><li>Last, add a little bit of salt to balance out the taste (I use around a 1/4-1/2 teaspoon)</li>
        </ol>
    <p>You can use this salsa for almost any Mexican dish. Whether it be while making tamales, putting them on your chilaquiles, or just adding flavor to your tacos or tlacoyos!</p>
